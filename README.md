# Welcome to the ESTER Project GitHub  

🌍 **ESTER – Estimating Population Dynamics for Europe and Western Asia (12,000 BP – Present)**  

This repository hosts open-source tools, datasets, and research outputs from the **ERC-funded ESTER project**. Our goal is to develop **computational models and archaeological datasets** to reconstruct past population dynamics across **Europe and Western Asia** over the past **12,000 years**.

## About ESTER  

The **ESTER project** (Estimating the Earth’s prehistoric population based on a large number of Records) is an **interdisciplinary research initiative** combining:  
- **Prehistoric archaeology** 🏺  
- **Paleoenvironmental science** 🌿  
- **Computational modeling** 🖥️  

Using advanced **spatial and demographic modeling**, ESTER aims to provide **quantitative estimates of past human populations** and their interactions with changing environments.  

📍 **Host Institution:** [University of Kiel](http://uni-kiel.de)  
📖 **Funding:** European Research Council (ERC) Consolidator Grant  

## What You'll Find Here  

🔹 **Open Datasets** – Chronological, archaeological, and paleoenvironmental datasets used in our research.  
🔹 **Computational Models** – Code for demographic reconstructions, simulations, and data analyses.  
🔹 **Scientific Publications** – Open-access papers and preprints related to ESTER research.  
🔹 **Collaboration & Community** – Guidelines for contributing and reusing our work.
